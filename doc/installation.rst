Installation
============

First, we recommend to install a virtual environment::

    $pip3 install pipenv

Via pip
-------
Then, OSM can be installed by pip from the master branch::

    pip3 install --user -U https://github.com/Pbarbecho/osm/archive/master.zip

This will install the osm package and its linked dependencies in your current python
library path. In case of a virtual environment is installed, the osm installation can be executed by calling pipenv osm --help.

Clone repository
----------------
As an stating point, cloning the osm project into a osm folder can be issued by executing the following command::

    git clone https://github.com/Pbarbecho/osm.git osm
