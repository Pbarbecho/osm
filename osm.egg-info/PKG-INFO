        # Automating OMNeT++ simulations tool OVSM #
        
        OSM allows to OMNeT++ users to quickly and easily execute large-scale network simulations. 
        This is an automation tool for OMNeT++ large-scale simulations and data analysis.
        Based on OMNeT++ structure, this tool reads .ini file and build simulation campaign.
        Users' manual an code documentation is available at [readthedocs][rtd].
        
        OSM tool includes the following tool:    
        ```bash
          - Launcher: build simulation campaign and execute parallel simulations in batches.
          - Parser:   Automatically try to detect output results files from simulation campaign (.vec,.sca, custom format) and convert those to an unique output file. 
          - Analyzer: Reads parsed files and plot results from template or launch an interactive plot in a web browser (pyvot tables). 
        ```
        
        ```bash
          # Build and lauch the simulation campaign
          $ovsm launcher [OPTIONS] INIFILE MAKEFILE
        
          # Summarize result files located in output folder
          $ovsm parser [OPTIONS] 
        
          # Analyze summarized file 
          $ovsm analyzer [OPTIONS] 
        ```
        
        
        ## Downloading the module ##
        
        This module is developed using
        [`pipenv`](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): in order to correctly
        manage virtual environments and install dependencies, make sure it is installed.
        Typically, the following is enough:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -U pipenv
        ```
        
        ## Clone the source repository from Github ##
        
        On the command line, enter:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Pbarbecho/ovsm.git
        ```
